# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
I have made several changes to my shorthand. Throughout my working process, I have been struggling to connect segments of my project into a holistic storytelling that reinforces my final call to action. With all the data I have I was also unsure of the sequence of these parts. With deep consideration, I decided to maintain my target audience to luxury brands and frame my storytelling as the following:


1. Use data from both the resale market value and consumer behavior to acknowledge that the once niche market is transforming the luxury industry.
Reasons for the rise of the market to prove that vintage luxury is not just a phase but a long-term trend that brands need to pay attention to.


The cultural influence: Met Gala where I talk about Met Gala, one of the most influential fashion events of the year that set trends while spotlighting important social and cultural   discourse. By showcasing how the theme and dress changed from maximalism and expressive to quiet luxury and vintage, the change in fashion consumption is clearly demonstrated.


The economic Influence: I showcase a graph with price inflation for three iconic bags to show that another reason the luxury resale is demanded is luxuryâ€™s affordability

Finally, I conclude with why should Brands care and how should brands respond?, followed by my call to action to ask brands to see resale as an opportunity rather than threat.

I also realized that I was not able to use pictures from Getty image for Met Gala outfits because it requires copyright, so I changed them into color palette. It does not look as aesthetically pleasing, but I hope it still o


## The audience
At first, my target audience was both the luxury customers and fashion brands. After discussing with my interviewees, I decideed to narrow my audience to simply the luxury brands since I did not have much data to convince customer to purchase from certified luxury resale store, and the order should be brands opening stores first, then they could start marketing towards customers.

## Final design decisions
I tried out different templates on shorthand, and I found this dark green one, which seems perfect for my project because green represents sustainability. I think it is intuitive for people to glance at my project and know that it's about sustainable fashion.

I initially had a static picture of the timeline, and after feedback, I decided to change the timeline to an interactive one, where each of the red carpet pictures are zoomed in, so that the audience could feel more engaging with clearer comparisons. I also wanted to include a chart with best seller items from lyst, but I decided to exclude this part because it does not fit into my storytelling.

# Final thoughts
I think other than storytelling, I found finding data related to this topic especially difficult since a lot of the data that could better reinforce my ideas are from private financial statements. Therefore, I did not directly find sales data but utilized other kinds of correlated data to prove my thesis. I think if I had more time, I would dive deeper into analyzing data on brands that currently own certified luxury resale stores or even conducting a survey about how likely are customers to purchase from a brand-associated resale stores to further enhance my call to action
