# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
My Target audiences are luxury and luxuey consumer, and my call to action is to let brands view resale market as opportunity inseatd of competition and ask persuade the consumer to purchase from brands-certified resale store


Interviews

Person 1: 24 years old, Masters of Entertainment Industry Management Student, Female

Person 2: 40 years old, Fashion and vintage enthusiast, Female

Person 3: 22 years old, CMU student, Male



What do you think the story is about?

Person 1: You use cultural events like Met Gala to talk about consumer behavior shift to sustainable fashion and quiet luxury that increase demand for resale market.

Person 2: The project talks about how fashion trends influence the resale market and why fashion brands should embrace the second-hand market as an opportunity rather than competition.

Person 3: It talks about the Met Gala and the resale market?



Do you think the sequence of the story flows?

Person 1: Yes it flows, but I think the transition could be smoother since you are talking about The Met Gala then inflation, very different things

Person 2: Yes! I like how you connect The Met Gala, something that I never thought of this connection, and I think it works really well. 

Person 3: Kinda, though I think you can explain in the Met Gala part, maybe write a little description about each outfit? It would be better for people who have no knowledge about fashion.



Do you think data reinforces my idea?

Person 1: I think the luxury inflation part is especially convincing!

Person 2 : I like the part where you show lines of how prices are inflated for three iconic brands.

Person 3: I was surprised when I see the bag inflation chart. Can’t believe people are spending so much on a bag. Definitely matches your project.



What do you think aesthetically?

Person 1: I like the idea of a timeline, but maybe you could make it more engaging? Maybe add some interaction? I would like to see zoom-in pictures of the outfits.

Person 2: I think the green color theme is great because you are talking about sustainability. Maybe adding some interaction?

Person 3: It looks like a fashion project at the first sight so I like it.


What else do you wish to see in this project?
Person 1: I think maybe add some examples or data about the brands that have opened their own resale store? I think it would be more convincing to persuade other brands to do the same.
Person 2: I think you could add some comparison between the retail and resale price.
Person 3: Maybe add more background so that people who doesn’t know fashion would be more engaged.


After reflecting both from the interview and the critique I get from class, I think I need to write more to provide better context and connect parts for a better story flow. I also decided to make my timeline more engaging and interactive, so people could really feel the comparison in themes between different years. I also want to add a call to action part at the end of my project to make the story more complete.
