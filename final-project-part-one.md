Topic: How do luxury resale platforms reflect cultural and economic shifts - and what do they reveal about the future of fashion consumption?

I am interested in the fashion industry and aspire to develop a career in fashion, particularly strategic marketing in high-end fashion brands. Therefore, I want to tell a story about the luxury resale market, which recently emerged as a powerful force in the fashion industry that reflects cultural and economic shifts and reshapes customer behaviors. 

There are various reasons contributing to the growth of second-hand luxury market like the rising awareness of sustainability, inflation of luxury brands, economic uncertainty post covid, social media trends, increasing purchasing power of the younger, eco-conscious generation, and so on, and all of which can lead us to think about the future of fashion consumption in the luxury sector: How does customersâ€™ mentality changed and how will brands approach to it?

According to the Robb Report, the luxury resale market reached $34.79 billion in value, which equates to 12% value of the new luxury market, and is expected to grow 10% to 15% annually. Luxury brands can no longer avoid the discourse on this rapidly growing sector. My target audiences are both the high fashion brands rather than the customers, and I wish to use this project to convince the brands to consider resale as an opportunity rather than competition with the shrifting consumer trend and make more people participate in the circular fashion.

I think my project will flow this way: Introduction, Breakdown of reasons behind the market, The challenge with counterfeiting, and Call to actions
Introduction
Starting with data about the booming resale luxury market to now 
Cultural Influence
Fashion trends shrift reflected by best sellers and met gala theme & dress code
Economic Influence
Inflation on luxury items
Call to Action/Recommendations

Method and Medium: I will be using Shorthand and Tableau for data visualization to display on website.










I plan to organize my data into two sections: the rise of the luxury resale market and the cultural and economic influences that led to the rise.

For the introduction, I will visualize the growing market value of the second-hand industry along with the value for the overall luxury industry to show the closing gap bewteen the two values. The data sources that I will use here are

This is the data for the whole luxury market value

For the next part, I will start with a diagram with statistics summarizing the reasons people prefer pre-owned items using https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/welcome-to-luxury-fashion-resale-discerning-customers-beckon-to-brands

Then I will demonstrate the cultural influence using the fashion trends shrifts reflected by best sellers brand rank by lyst and themes and dress codes of the met gala year by year with a timline. The data sources I will be using are:

I will then talk about the economic influence that contribute to the growth of resale market by mentioning the Inflation on luxury items for various brands:

Finally, I will conclude my project to ask luxury to consider resale market as an opportunity to expand their target audience and leverage it to enhance their brand image.
